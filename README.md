## ⚙️ Features

- 🌡️ Simulates temperature readings from a sensor  
- 🧠 Determines thermostat mode automatically:
  - Heat
  - Cool
  - Off (Neutral)
- 🔁 Runs continuously in a loop  
- 📝 Logs temperature readings and thermostat mode to a file  
- ⚙️ Uses a JSON configuration file for temperature thresholds  
- 🧪 Includes basic unit tests

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project was built to:
- Strengthen Python fundamentals  
- Apply object-oriented programming concepts  
- Practice modular and maintainable code structure  
- Work with configuration-based decision making  
- Implement logging and unit testing  

---

## 📌 Notes

- This project is intentionally kept simple and CLI-based  
- Designed as a learning-focused implementation rather than a production system
